cr_erinyes,SHIP,"Designed to bring heavy firepower to frigate and destroyer wolfpacks, the Erinyes-class light cruiser is the largest publicly known ship ever fitted with a phase skimmer, and the design is severely constrained because of it. Its powerful armament outpaces its miniaturized power core, its armor is the thinnest of any ship classified as a cruiser, and its advanced systems make it an expensive ship to field and maintain. Nonetheless, the tactical options enabled by the phase skimmer make the Erinyes a viciously dangerous light cruiser.",,,
cr_auxilia,SHIP,"Using the Legion as both a design inspiration and a components source, the Auxilia was developed by the Domain Navy to fulfill the Legion’s role in situations that either didn’t require or didn’t allow for the full capital-class ship to be fielded.

Now a venerable design in its own right, the Auxilia finds frequent use throughout the sector in both independent fleets and the Hegemony Navy.",,,
cr_diaphane,SHIP,"The Diaphane brought military-grade survey and scanning capabilities to the frontier of the Domain without arming fringe militants with advanced combat blueprints. The ship is highly automated, immensely efficient, and a common sight in civilian and trade fleets throughout the Sector, its repurposed exploratory scanners watching for incoming threats.

Originally armed with only a single point defense mount, the survey probe launcher and shuttle bay have been modified to operate as a missile system and flight deck respectively, but the ship is otherwise sorely lacking in defensive options.",,,
cr_matchlock,SHIP,"An exceptionally affordable vessel, the Matchlock was built to provide some measure of relief from pirates and smugglers to even the most impoverished of fringe Domain colonies. Its high speed, ease of acquisition, and vast stock of missiles for its size have made it an ideal fit for the conditions of the Sector post-Collapse.",,,
cr_spirit,SHIP,"The Spirit-class command destroyer trades some of the raw agility typical of high-tech vessels for an integrated operations center, extensive electronics suite, and relatively sturdy - for a high-tech destroyer - armor protection. The ship’s full-sized flight deck and point defense drones round out a versatile and adaptable design that remains a popular flagship for both Tri-Tachyon and private fleet operators.",,,
cr_cataphract,SHIP,"Designed during the advent of early shield generators, the Cataphract-class underwent a mid-development redesign, trading armor for external shield emitter nodes. Inexperience with shield integration left its early power cores overtaxed, and the design was never mass produced. Post-Collapse, scavengers uncovered an archived engineering thesis on failed warship designs, complete with a blueprint that included power core improvements, leading to the Cataphract’s revival as a highly capable heavy frigate.

One distinct advantage of the design - acknowledged both in the distant past and in the present - is the Cataphract’s exceptional speed, a legacy of engines once meant to move far heavier armor.",,,
cr_valravn,SHIP,"The Valravn-class cruiser, an Altair Exotech “Cruiser School” design, was built around a single large ballistic hardpoint – an answer to fears that modern warships were abandoning heavy gun platforms entirely. Domain Navy traditionalists balked at its relatively light armor and reliance on energy-based point defenses, and the Valravn quickly became another flashpoint in Altair Exotech’s portfolio of divisive designs.",,,
